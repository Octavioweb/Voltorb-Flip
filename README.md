# Voltorb-Flip
Python copy of the game of guessing nonograms. Made in 2021 while learning game basics.


## Introduction
This game was made reading the book "Making Games with Python and Pygame" by Al Sweigart. 

Made entirely with pygame base functions, including topics like randomness, mathematics, and game logic. The required knowledge to make this was understaing some intermediate game concepts, and applying them, such as FPS, event managment, secuence of the code, front-end and back-end. Finally, the game was made such that all the game sizes and variables can be changed, and it will adapt to the changes; for example, one can change the number of board rows, and the game will automatilcally change the size of the font, the square sized, etc. 

## How to play

The game is played in a NxN board (by default, 5x5), and there board haves number in the bottom part, and the right part. The number represent the number of "mines" in that row or column. One must read this numbers, and conclude if there where are the mines in the board. The final objective is to clear all the mines in the board to win. This somethimes requiere some luck.
